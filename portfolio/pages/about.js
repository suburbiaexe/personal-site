                        Hey! My name is Elizabeth, and I'm a Junior at Brown
                        University. I'm originally from Seattle, Washington, so
                        I've been surrounded by art, tech, and music for my
                        entire life (on this page is one of my core playlists â€”
                        if you let me I will talk about it ad infinitum)! My
                        parents gave me unfettered access to the internet at far
                        too young of an age, so I spent a significant portion of
                        my adolescence scrolling away on Tumblr. However,
                        running my tweenage blog gave me early exposure to web
                        development with basic HTML/CSS, and I grew to love
                        designing the internet so much that I'm now (somehow)
                        three years into earning a Computer Science degree.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm currently a Co-Director for Hack@Brown, the club
                        responsible for organizing Brown's largest and oldest
                        student-run hackathon. I'm primarily interested in
                        front-end engineering, but I also have experience with
                        UI/UX and product design work (and am a big fan of
                        computer graphics). Most of my time is spent thinking
                        about aesthetics and accessibility, as well as gathering
                        inspiration from posters and editorials!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I'm not working, I enjoy listening to music,
                        curating Spotify Playlists, and playing crossword
                        puzzles, the piano, and The Sims 4.
