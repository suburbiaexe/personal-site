                        Hey! My name is Elizabeth, and I&apos;m a Senior at
                        Brown University. I&apos;m originally from Seattle,
                        Washington, so I&apos;ve been surrounded by{" "}
                        <span className={styles.highlighter}>
                            art, tech, and music
                        </span>{" "}
                        for my entire life (on this page is one of my core
                        playlists â€” if you let me I will talk about it ad
                        infinitum)! My parents gave me unfettered access to the
                        internet at far too young of an age, so I spent a
                        significant portion of my adolescence scrolling away on
                        Tumblr. However, running my tweenage blog gave me early
                        exposure to{" "}

                        </span>{" "}
                        with basic HTML/CSS, and I grew to love designing the
                        internet so much that I&apos;m now (somehow) three years
                        into earning a Computer Science degree.

                        This past summer, I worked as a{" "}

                        on the Customer Experience team, and I&apos;m thrilled
                        to be returning as a full-time engineer after I
                        graduate! Previously, I was a Co-Director for
                        Hack@Brown, the club responsible for organizing
                        Brown&apos;s largest and oldest student-run hackathon.
                        I&apos;m primarily a frontend engineer, but I also have
                        experience with{" "}
                        <span className={styles.highlighter}>UI/UX</span> and{" "}

                        </span>{" "}
                        work (and am a big fan of computer graphics). Most of my
                        time is spent thinking about aesthetics and
                        accessibility, as well as gathering inspiration from
                        posters and editorials!

                        When I&apos;m not working, I enjoy listening to music,
                        curating Spotify Playlists, and playing crossword
                        puzzles, the piano, and The Sims 4.
