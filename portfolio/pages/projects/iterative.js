                        This was a group project with three other students in
                        which we created a hi-fi prototype of a mobile app based
                        on Slingshot, a YC startup that automatically reduces
                        medical bills. As you might be able to guess, the focus
                        of this project was the iterative design process:
                        improving upon our mockup at each stage, from initial
                        sketches to user testing.

                        This was an incredibly valuable project, as I not only
                        got exposure to the product design process, but I also
                        learned more about the dynamics of working with other
                        designers to create a cohesive product.
